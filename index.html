          Sergio Ramos García (Spanish pronunciation: [seɾxjo ramoz ɣaɾθi.a];[A]
          born 30 March 1986) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for
          Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Spain national team.[3] He
          most notably played as a centre-back for Real Madrid for 16
          seasons,[4] whom he captained for six seasons.[5][6] He has previously
          played as a right-back earlier in his career.[7] Known for his
          goalscoring capabilities and leadership skills, he is widely
          considered as one of the greatest defenders and captains in the
          history of the sport.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] After emerging
          through Sevilla's youth academy and spending two seasons with the
          senior side, Ramos moved to Real Madrid in the summer of 2005.[7]
          Since then, he went on to become a mainstay for Real Madrid, and had
          won 22 major honours, including five La Liga titles and four UEFA
          Champions League titles, becoming one of La Liga's top goalscorers
          from a defensive position. He played a crucial part in the build-up to
          all four UEFA Champions League wins, being named in the competition
          Squad of the Season each time. He also notably scored the equaliser in
          the 93rd minute of the 2014 UEFA Champions League Final.[16][17] Ramos
          has been named to the FIFPro World11 eleven times; a record for a
          defender, and the third-most all-time. He has also been elected to the
          UEFA Team of the Year nine times, also a record for a defender and the
          third-most of any player. Additionally, Ramos has been named La Liga's
          Best Defender a record five times, and to the La Liga Team of the
          Season in 2015–16. In 2021, he joined Paris Saint-Germain on a free
          transfer.

          Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (born 5 February 1992), known as Neymar,
          is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for
          Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. He is
          widely regarded as one of the best players in the world.[7] Neymar
          came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut
          aged 17. He helped the club win two successive Campeonato Paulista
          championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the 2011 Copa Libertadores; the
          latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the
          South American Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012, and soon
          relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's
          attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, he won the
          continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA
          Champions League, and finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015
          for his performances. He then attained a domestic double in the
          2015–16 season. In 2017, Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain in
          a move worth €222 million, making him the most expensive player
          ever.[note 1] In France, Neymar won three league titles, three Coupe
          de France, and two Coupe de la Ligue, which included a domestic treble
          and being voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year in his debut season.[10]
          Neymar helped PSG attain a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season,
          and led the club to its first ever Champions League Final.
