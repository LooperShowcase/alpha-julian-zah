      Sergio Ramos García (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈseɾxjo ˈramoz ɣaɾˈθi.a];[A]
      born 30 March 1986) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for
      Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Spain national team.[3] He most
      notably played as a centre-back for Real Madrid for 16 seasons,[4] whom he
      captained for six seasons.[5][6] He has previously played as a right-back
      earlier in his career.[7] Known for his goalscoring capabilities and
      leadership skills, he is widely considered as one of the greatest
      defenders and captains in the history of the
      sport.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] After emerging through Sevilla's
      youth academy and spending two seasons with the senior side, Ramos moved
      to Real Madrid in the summer of 2005.[7] Since then, he went on to become
      a mainstay for Real Madrid, and had won 22 major honours, including five
      La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles, becoming one of La
      Liga's top goalscorers from a defensive position. He played a crucial part
      in the build-up to all four UEFA Champions League wins, being named in the
      competition Squad of the Season each time. He also notably scored the
      equaliser in the 93rd minute of the 2014 UEFA Champions League
      Final.[16][17] Ramos has been named to the FIFPro World11 eleven times; a
      record for a defender, and the third-most all-time. He has also been
      elected to the UEFA Team of the Year nine times, also a record for a
      defender and the third-most of any player. Additionally, Ramos has been
      named La Liga's Best Defender a record five times, and to the La Liga Team
      of the Season in 2015–16. In 2021, he joined Paris Saint-Germain on a free
      transfer. Internationally, Ramos represented the Spanish national team at
      four World Cups and three European Championships. He won the 2010 FIFA
      World Cup and the UEFA European Championship in 2008 and 2012, being named
      to the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2010, and the UEFA Euro Team of the
      Tournament in 2012. He made his first appearance for Spain at the age of
      18 and, in 2013, he became the nation's youngest player to ever reach 100
      caps.[18] Ramos currently holds the record as the most capped player in
      the history of the Spanish national team, and is his country's
      eighth-highest all-time goalscorer. He also holds the record of most
      international victories for Spain with 131 matches won.[19]
